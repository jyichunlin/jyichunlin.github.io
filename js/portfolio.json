        "description": "Pancreas is a granular organ in the digested system. In this illustration, you can appreciate how many essential abdominal organs and vessels surround the pancreas. Therefore, the Pancreatic surgery to treat cancer and other conditions is one of the most difficult operations. \nI based my illustration on a dissected specimen of digested tract mounted in a glass container in Grant’s museum at University of Toronto where many original dissections that were illustrated in Grant’s Atlas of Anatomy are stored and displayed. I used carbon dust technique to depict various tissue textures to clearly show the different structures."

        "description": "The pelvic bone connects the body to the lower limbs. Besides its unique shape that allows it to support the body and protect the reproductive organs, it also contains many bony landmarks where muscles and ligaments of the abdomen, back and legs attach. \nI based this illustration on a left male human pelvic bone specimen. I experimented on using various mark making and directions of the lines to portray the distinct shape of the bone and different textures of bony protrusions."

        "description": "The neural tube, a precursor to the central nervous system in the human embryo, closes during the fourth week of embryo development.  When it does not close properly, a birth defect called spina bifida occurs. Myelomeningocele is the most servere form of spina bifida occurring in about one in every thousand newborns. Babies are born with fluid sacs, where their posterior vertebral arches are absent and the spinal cord is exposed. \nIn this piece, I depicted the myelomeningocele newborn spine in comparison with the normal newborn spine to highlight the incompletion of structural development.

        "description": "This piece aims to explain the complex relationship between the pathology of vestibular schwannoma and its clinical symptoms. The stages of tumor growth are corresponded with affected nerves and symptoms. By depicting these three concepts together, students can easily and realistic rendering of cranial nerves and ear anatomy, respectively, creates visual contrast and enhances the focus on cranial nerves. Analogous color is used for the ear structure, and more contrast and brighter color are used to highlight cranial nerves. Color codes of cranial nerves are maintained throughout the piece to help students cross-reference the structures."

        "description": "T cell transfer colitis in mice is an established model for understanding the pathogenesis and cure of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Regulatory T cells (Treg) can suppress helper T cells proliferate. Without the ability to produce regulatory T cells, the genetically engineered mice develop IBD. Recent studies show the Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) serve similar function as regulatory T cells to regulate and may hold the key to the cure for IBD. \nI want to illustrate the dynamic environment in the colon, and show the immune response in three structural levels: tissue, cellular and molecular level. To orient the reader, The different levels are organized from the top to the bottom of the page. Therefore, the reader can have an overview first, and dive in deeper to learn the cellular and molecular interactions. At the same time, the difference of three experimental conditions is clear by comparing the reactions side by side."

        "description": "IMS magazine is a student-led publication that features the cutting-edge health science research by the faculty and students from the Institute of Medical Science (IMS) at University of Toronto. I collaborated with staff and other students in Institute of Medical Science to design layout and create illustrations for the magazine. \nFor this issue, we wanted to design a brand new style and layout for the magazine. To accompany this article about the innovative imaging technology for the stroke patient, I also created a full-page illustration to visualize the dynamic environment in the bloodstream."

        "description": "Chronic low back pain is a common health problem worldwide that has a serious impact on an individual’s quality of life. This animation focuses on the concept of multidisciplinary approaches and offers a broad perspective on the causes and treatments of chronic low back pain. It aims to unravel the mystery of chronic low back pain and help patients understand some of the most difficult topics surrounding this health problem, such as complex anatomical structures of the lower back, the pain pathway, and the underlying mechanisms of treatments. In addition, to tailor toward the general public audiences, the animation uses engaging tones, warm and saturated color scheme and easily comprehensible images which incorporate realistic and schematic rendering styles."

        "description": "Lung ultrasound has been successfully used in diagnosing the cause of respiratory failure in the Emergency Department and has been shown to have higher sensitivity and specificity than chest X ray and physical examination in detecting pleural effusions and pneumothorax. \nI created lung, diaphragm and spleen models to match the existing organ assets. I also created animations to depict the lung movements that synchronize with the ultrasound clips. Combining all assets, I designed and developed the module that aligned with the existing applications on the site."
